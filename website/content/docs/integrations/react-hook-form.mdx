In this guide, we will take a look at integrating Emblor with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), a popular form library for React applications. React Hook Form is a lightweight and performant library that allows you to build forms with ease. By integrating Emblor with React Hook Form, you can create a fully-featured tag input component that is highly customizable and accessible.

## Installation

First, install Emblor and React Hook Form by running the following command:

<br />

```bash
npm install emblor react-hook-form
# Or, use any package manager of your choice.
```

## Integration with React-Hook-Form

Integrating Emblor with react-hook-form allows for easy form validation, submission, and more complex forms management. Here's how to integrate effectively:

### Basic integration

<br />

```tsx
import { useForm, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';
import { Tag, TagInput } from 'emblor';

function TagForm() {
  const { control, handleSubmit, setValue } = useForm();
  const [tags, setTags] = React.useState<Tag[]>([]);

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    console.log(data.tags); // Process tag data
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <Controller
        name="tags"
        control={control}
        render={({ field }) => (
          <TagInput
            {...field}
            placeholder="Enter a topic"
            tags={tags}
            className="sm:min-w-[450px]"
            setTags={(newTags) => {
              setTags(newTags);
              setValue('topics', newTags as [Tag, ...Tag[]]);
            }}
          />
        )}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default TagForm;
```

Overall the integration is straightforward. We use the Controller component from react-hook-form to manage the input field. The Controller component takes a name prop, which is the name of the field in the form data. The render prop is a function that returns the input component. In this case, we return the TagInput component from Emblor.
