🐞 Bug Fixes

- Applied a width of `fit-content` to the input component when `includeTagsInInput` is enabled.
- Addressed an issue where the input was taking the full width of the container, causing tags to stack on top of the input.
- Ensured that the input and tags are displayed inline, improving the user experience and layout consistency.
