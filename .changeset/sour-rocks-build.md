ðŸš€ Features:

New Styling API: Introduced a styling API for the TagInput component and its subcomponents. This update allows developers to customize the appearance of each part of the component using a structured classNames prop. Each subcomponent, including TagList, Autocomplete, and TagPopover, can now be styled individually to match specific design requirements.

Detailed Enhancements Include:

- TagInput: Ability to apply custom classes to the main container and input elements.
- TagList: Customization options for the list container and individual tags, including sortable lists.
- Autocomplete: Extended styling capabilities for autocomplete triggers, content, command lists, and items.
- TagPopover: Options to style the popover content and triggers separately.
- Tag: Enhanced control over the tag container and close button styling.
